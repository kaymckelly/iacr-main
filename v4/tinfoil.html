      <h1>For our non-javascript users</h1>
      <p>
        If you are seeing this, it's probably because you tried to
        visit <a href="https://iacr.org/">iacr.org</a> with a browser
        that does not run javascript. I'm not going to try and convince
        you to turn on javascript, but I'm going to explain why I think
        this risk is overstated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web has a 25-year-old history of security problems, and
        there is good reason to be skeptical about security when
        browsing the web. On the other hand, most of the modern web is
        now built with javascript, and a large amount of effort has
        gone into making it <em>possible</em> to use javascript
        safely. Unfortunately much of the use of javascript on the web
        is designed to facilite advertising and data collection for
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance
        economy</a>. The result is that this de facto use of javascript
        has led to a loss of trust in the technology itself.
      </p>
      <H3>Same origin policy</h3>
      <p>
        Most of the security and privacy problems of javascript are
        addressed by
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">same-origin
          policy</a> implemented by browsers.  This policy was formed
        back in the late 90s, and was the cornerstone of the first web
        security models.
      </p>
      <p>
        IACR has recently adopted the policy that all new javascript,
        css, and images will be hosted directly from iacr.org (with a few
        exceptions below). We will
        no longer use content distribution networks, and we will no
        longer use software from third-party sources if it must be
        hosted from their site.  This policy change is to address two
        issues:
        <ol>
          <li>When a page embeds third-party content that is hosted from another
            server, the result is that the third party site gets notified
            about every visitor to the host site because the browser must request
            the embedded content. This is a privacy leak that
            some businesses have exploited to boost their business, but provides
            no direct value to the user.
          </li>
          <li>Third-party javascript that is loaded from a third-party site
            has the ability to communicate back to that server. By contrast, the
            same-origin policy implemented by web browsers restricts the access of
            javascript that is hosted from iacr.org so that it cannot communicate
            with other sites.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h3>Exceptions to the policy</h3>
      <p>
        There are a few exceptions to the policy mentioned
        above. First, for users who choose to make use of Google
        Search, the searchbar at the top will by default take you to a
        page on iacr.org that embeds javascript from Google to fetch
        search results for iacr.org. There is
        an <a href="/lse">alternative search stack</a> that resides on
        iacr.org and does not require third-party content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, there are a few pages on the site that use javascript
        to display map information from third parties. These will
        continue to load javascript and tiles from open maps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it will take us a while to completely remove
        third-party content, but we will start with the most
        commonly visited pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cryptographers are professionally paranoid. That a good thing - it teaches us
        to think adversarially about risks, and to be conservative in the adoption
        of technology. At the same time, life is about balancing risk vs reward, not
        about avoiding all risk at all costs.

      <h3>How to use this site</h3>
      <p>
        One way to use this site is to create an exception in your browser
        to allow javascript to run on iacr.org. The method for doing this
        depends on your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the content on this site can be browsed without
        javascript. Due to maintainability issues, the
        navigation <a href="header.html">header</a>
        and <a href="footer.html">footer</a> are fetched via
        javascript ajax requests and inserted into pages on
        iacr.org. These pages are simple html files themselves, and
        will allow you to navigate to most pages on iacr.org.  You can
        bookmark them in your browser for a viable home page on
        iacr.org.
